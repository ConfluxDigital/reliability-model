Failure Frequency,metric,4-key-metrics|change failure rate|internal,"How often does something break. Commonly measured by MTBF - Mean Time Between Failure. 
Important to note that this looks at simply did something fail, not whether it was a customer-impacting failure. That is considered by the customer impact and intensity."
